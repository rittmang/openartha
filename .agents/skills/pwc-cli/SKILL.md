description: "Papers With Code CLI (`pwc`) for searching and reading AI/ML papers, discovering recent and trending research, finding related work and paper lineage, browsing tasks, methods, conferences, organizations, frameworks, and benchmark leaderboards through the public Papers With Code catalog. Use whenever the user asks to find papers, survey literature, compare research, inspect an arXiv paper, explore AI/ML taxonomy or conferences, discover benchmarks or state-of-the-art models, or mentions Papers With Code, `pwc`, or `pwc-cli`."

Generated with `pwc v0.3.0`. Run `pwc skills add --force` to regenerate.

The `pwc` CLI is anonymous and read-only. It queries the public
[Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.co) catalog and requires no token.
Run `pwc --help` or a nested `--help` command when the live parser and this
skill disagree; the parser is authoritative.

Use compact output for reading and discovery. Add `--json` for programmatic
filtering, joining, or schema-dependent processing.

When the user identifies an author, prefer repeatable structured
`pwc paper list --author AUTHOR` filters. Add `--search TEXT` for stated topic
terms and explicit `--order-by date_published --order-dir desc` for newest or
recent work. Author references accept an exact normalized name, numeric ID, or
`@HF_USERNAME`; repeated authors use AND semantics.

Publication date ranges are inclusive: use `--start-date YYYY-MM-DD` and
`--end-date YYYY-MM-DD` with `pwc search` or `pwc paper list`; the start date
must not be later than `--end-date`.

Paper discovery commands accept `--implementation-coverage` to add official
implementation status and total linked repository count columns. JSON and
`pwc paper info` always include both fields. Use
`--has-official-implementation` with `pwc search` or `pwc paper list` to require
a catalog-linked official repository; these filters fail closed if unconfirmed.

Use `pwc benchmark --name NAME --max-parameters SIZE` to keep models at or
below an inclusive parameter limit. SIZE accepts values such as `500M`, `1.5B`,
`3B`, and raw integers. Models without one consistent parameter count are
excluded from constrained results.

`PAPER` accepts a modern or legacy arXiv ID, a numeric external-paper ID, or an
exact paper title. Quote titles containing spaces. Title matching is
case-insensitive but exact; ambiguous titles fail with their matching IDs.

## Research workflow

1. Use `pwc benchmark list --task TASK` to discover active benchmarks, then
   `pwc benchmark --name NAME` to inspect a leaderboard. Add
   `--max-parameters SIZE` when model size is part of the request.
2. Use `pwc paper info` to inspect promising results. Add
   `--include-resources` when repositories, project pages, or Hugging Face
   artifacts matter.
3. Use exact `pwc paper list --author`, `--task`, `--method`, `--conference`,
   `--framework`, and `--organization` filters for known identities or catalog
   associations. Combine them to require every association; do not substitute
   a keyword search. Add `--search` for title or abstract topic terms.
4. Use `pwc search` for broader discovery, then `pwc paper read` for primary
   evidence.
5. Expand the literature with `pwc paper related` and use
   `pwc paper lineage list` when model or method ancestry matters.
6. Preserve paper titles, identifiers, and URLs so claims remain traceable.

## Output and limits

- Interactive output is optimized for people. Benchmark lists remain aligned
  when captured; other captured list output uses lossless TSV. Add `--json` for
  structured agent or script consumption.
- Stable exit codes are `0` success, `2` invalid usage, `3` network/server
  failure, and `4` invalid API response.
- `PWC_API_URL` may select another compatible v1 endpoint. The default is
  `https://paperswithcode.co/api/v1`.
- Catalog-filtered paper lists fail closed unless the server confirms every
  requested filter; never treat results from an older server as filtered.
- Parameter-filtered benchmark details fail closed unless the server confirms
  parameter-filter support and every returned model satisfies the limit.

The research commands contain no authentication, catalog mutation, ingestion,
publication, image, embedding, CRON, or infrastructure-maintenance operations.
